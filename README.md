# Requests
Contains information on requested &amp; required mods for current and future AOF modpacks.

## Details
This repo contains an assortment of mods ideas for modpack usage.
A few appropriate examples might be:
 - Simple Underground Dungeons
 - Better Villager Trade Reputation
 - Food Hunger Scaling

The only requirement is that you keep modpack usage in mind. A request for a personal client-side mod which keeps track of Hypixel Bed War wins (while cool) is not appropriate for the list.

Below, you'll find a list of requests & ideas alongside a short description. An idea can also have a link to a file inside the repo which can contain more information on the mod-- try to move anything more than a few sentences into a separate file using this system.

- **User Structures**: allow the user to add in custom structures that spawn in their world. Consists of a structure nbt file and a config file that defines how and where the structure spawns.

- **Tougher Food**: an addition to the slower hunger loss mod which makes plants take more maintence to grow and manage. Weeds and worms included.
- **Thirst**: add a thirst meter which can be filled by drinking from water source blocks or water bottles.
- **Boss Music**: certain events trigger music. Intensity of the music depends on the player's distance from whatever is happening.
- **Patchou... or not?**: guidebook API for devs.
- **Nostalgia**: after defeating the Enderdragon, (https://youtu.be/xLfm2nnCOpc)[this] music plays. You're shown a panoramic of your home base and see the credits slowly roll in the right corner. The panoramic finishes right as you near the end of the credit story, at which time the credits take up the whole screen again, for the last (and most impactful) final words. Draw out the emotion you get after beating the elite 4! 
- **Overview**: display information on what the player has done every night, similar to Stardew Valley. Show how many blocks they mined, how many steps they walked, and how much the local difficulty changed.
- **Cloudy Sky**: https://i.imgur.com/Dqit8.gif
- **Sweet Home**: a mod that works to encourage players to build cozy bases. Maybe lock certain actions, such as mining, until 15 days into the world?

- **City Builder**: encourage the player to build large cities and towns, which invites villagers and new citizens. Maybe lock certain resources behind citizen trades?
- **Asteroid Belt**: allow outer end islands to spawn at any height in the world.
- **Village API**: API for adding village structures.
- **Skill Leveling**: skills (mining, harvesting, lumbering) have levels, and you can't do certain actions without a level. For example, diamonds require level 15. One idea is to stay away from a numerical approach; keep numbers away from the user, and simply alert them to when new things can be mined (eg. "You notice a speck of blue while mining... maybe you should try and break it?"). Could also hide certain blocks, such as ores, until the correct level is hit.

### Completed Ideas
- **Loot Bags**: any sort of loot bag mechanic which is obtained through quests and mob kills.
  - completed by B0undarybreaker with **OLBM**.
