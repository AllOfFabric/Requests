# Requests
Contains information on requested &amp; required mods for current and future AOF modpacks.

## Details
This repo contains an assortment of mods that are needed (or wanted!) for AOF modpack usage.
A few appropriate examples might be:
 - Simple Underground Dungeons
 - Better Villager Trade Reputation
 - Overworld Ore Generation JSON Config

The only requirement is that you keep AOF modpack usage in mind. A request for a personal client-side mod which keeps track of Hypixel Bed War wins (while cool) is not appropriate for the list.

Below, you'll find a list of requests & ideas alongside a short description. An idea can also have a link to a file inside the repo which can contain more information on the mod-- try to move anything more than a few sentences into a separate file using this system.

### Requests & Ideas
- **Overworld Ore Generation JSON Config**: allow the user to specify & configure how ores are spawned in the overworld in a simple json file. Optionally allow for other dimensions as well.
- **Storage System Mod**: any sort of mod that adds in an AE2 style storage system.
