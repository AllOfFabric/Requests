# Requests
Contains information on requested &amp; required mods for current and future AOF modpacks.

## Details
This repo contains an assortment of mods that are needed (or wanted!) for AOF modpack usage.
A few appropriate examples might be:
 - Simple Underground Dungeons
 - Better Villager Trade Reputation
 - Food Hunger Scaling

The only requirement is that you keep AOF modpack usage in mind. A request for a personal client-side mod which keeps track of Hypixel Bed War wins (while cool) is not appropriate for the list.

Below, you'll find a list of requests & ideas alongside a short description. An idea can also have a link to a file inside the repo which can contain more information on the mod-- try to move anything more than a few sentences into a separate file using this system.

### Requests & Ideas

- **Better Rivers**: replace standard biome edge rivers with new rivers that are placed based on noise. New rivers have a bed of a mix of stone to give it more texture, and can occasionally have ocean plants for a bit of extra life.
- **Higher Nether**: move the nether ceiling to the world height, and also bring up the base floor by the same amount
  - **Underground Nether Megadungeons**: in the space created near the bottom by moving the nether up, add in giant dungeon labyrinths that span hundreds of blocks.
- **Nether Spikes**: add giant spikes or obsidian and glowstone to the nether for a bit of extra detail.

  - **Jigsaw Edition**: use the Jigsaw system to expand villages out by re-generating them at the edge with the size limits slightly removed.
