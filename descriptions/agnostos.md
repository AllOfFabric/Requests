# Agnostos


Agnostos is a mod for Minecraft dedicated to expanding upon existing game functionality and following the design philosophy of Mojang. I believe it would be an excellent fit for the AOF pack because of its simplistic, Minecraft+ kind of nature. While it is still early in development, and does not have many features, the features it does have are well refined, thoughtful, and stable so there should be no issues surrounding balance problems.


The headline features of Agnostos are currently
- The Totem of Returning: An expensive one time use quick transport option
- The Totem of Shielding: Similar to the Totem of Undying but shields incoming damage until the durability is gone
- The Totem of Holding: A one time use totem that prevents players from dropping their items on death
- An expensive crafting recipe for the Totem of Undying
- Turf: A block with the grass texture on all sides
- Elgrove Trees: A new type of tree similar to oak trees that are found within the enchanted forest biome
- The Enchanted Forest Biome: A magical forest full of friendly and hostile creatures
    - Pillagers are natives to the enchanted forest and naturally spawn there
- Any color wool can be dyed into any other color wool
- Stone tools can be crafted from any type of stone
- Abandoned Campgrounds: Small randomly generated overworld structures that are just as they say, abandoned campgrounds
- When Trinkets (An optional dependency) is installed a special Totem Slot is added into the game
- Snow layers can be reduced by right clicking with a shovel
- Sneaking in sweet berry bushes prevents the damage
- Chickens can be sheared
- Chickens also naturally shed feathers
